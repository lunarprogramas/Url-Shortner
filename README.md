# ðŸ”— | URL Shortner

This backend API allows you to create shortened URLs for your favourite websites!

To get started simply create a POST request at (using localhost) `http://localhost:3000` and make sure to include the ``url`` body parameter with the website you wish to forward.

Then simply go to your web browser or create a `GET` request at `http://localhost:3000/{code}` (replace {code} with the generated code you recieved) and you will be redirected to the website.
